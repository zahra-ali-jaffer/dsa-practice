1. **Object_Oriented_Design** – Principles and implementation of OOP in Java.
2. **Analysis_of_Algorithms** – Complexity analysis, Big O notation, and algorithm evaluation.
3. **ADTs_and_Collections** – Abstract Data Types and Java Collections framework.
4. **Arrays_Stacks_Queues_Sets** – Fundamentals of arrays, stacks, queues, and sets.
5. **Linear_Linked_Structures** – Linked lists and related operations.
6. **Stacks_and_Applications** – Stack implementations and common use cases.
7. **Queues_and_Applications** – Queue implementations and applications.
8. **Hash_Tables** – Hashing techniques and table implementations.
9. **Sets_and_Applications** – Sets, operations, and problem-solving examples.
10. **Maps_and_Applications** – Map interfaces, hash maps, and practical examples.
11. **Lists** – List operations and algorithms.
12. **Recursion** – Recursive algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
13. **Trees** – Binary trees, traversal methods, and tree algorithms.
14. **Sorting_and_Searching** – Sorting algorithms, searching techniques, and complexity analysis.

### Other Folders

Separate folders contain **focused problems and solutions across different DSA topics, from NeetCode and LeetCode**, with more topics to be added over time. Each file includes detailed explanations and Java implementations.
