//Modelling Doubly-Linked Lists
//DoubleNode, DoubleList, DoubleIterator
//DoubleList is an interesting class because it is abstract (it cannot be created), but all of the methods here will be concrete to ease the burden on implementers.
//Majority protected classes are not supposed to be used by general client, but by those implementing various collection ADTs(such as ordered and indexed lists)
//Simpler methods such as isEmpty() and size() are public and can be called from client code directly.
