//ADTs and Collections
//An Abstract Data Type (or ADT) is a specification of a set of data, and the set of operations that can be performed on it.
//It’s abstract because the focus is on defining properties on the data, and the behaviour of the operations, rather than the exact implementation 

//2 bits of Information (abstract structure of the data, and typical operations that can be performed on it)

//Collections --> group of other objects of a fixed type

ArrayList<Book> bookshelf = new ArrayList<>(100);
java.util.HashSet<Treasure> myTreasure = new java.util.HashSet<>();
java.util.HashMap<String, Correspondence> phoneBook = new java.util.HashMap<>(25);

//Categorising collections -> Formation, Organisation, Size
//Formation -> Unordered, Linear and Non-Linear
//Organisation -> Order they were added, Dependant on relationship between elements
//Size -> Bounded(Fixed size), Unbounded(Dynamic)

//All Collections -> isEmpty() & size()
//Bounded Collections also -> isFull() & capacity()

//Exceptions
public Map<Prize, Ticket> luckyDraw(){
  Map<Prize, Ticket> winners = new HashMap<>();
  try { //Important 
    for (Prize prize : prizes) {
      winners.put(prize, tickets.draw()); //Normal case
    }
  } catch (IllegalStateException ise) {//Looking for specific error
    return winners; // Error case
  }
  return winners;
}

//Bounded Collection - Modelling isFull() and capacity()

public interface Bounded {
  /** Returns true if collection has no more room for more elements */
  public boolean isFull(); // Remember, interfaces have no bodies on methods
  
  /** Returns the maximum elements a collection can hold */
  public int capacity();
}

//Bounded shouldn’t need to extend java.lang.Iterable because that’s a feature of a collection
//Java interfaces (not the other type of interface) typically define a set of abstract methods, such as public abstract int size(); but will not contain any data members(fields)
//Classes and interfaces modelling collections should be generic 
//Regardless of what the collection is storing -> it will count the elements in the same way to determine the size of the collection.

//Collection ADTs
//Stacks

public interface StackADT<T> {
