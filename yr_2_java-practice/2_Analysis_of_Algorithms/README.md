# Analysis of Algorithms – Practice

Analysis of algorithms focuses on evaluating how efficiently a program runs as input size grows. Time complexity describes this growth using Big-O notation, which measures how loops, recursion, and operations scale with data. Nested loops increase complexity, where one loop typically leads to O(n), two nested loops to O(n²), and three nested loops to O(n³). By identifying how code structures expand with input size, we can compare solutions, predict performance, and choose more efficient approaches.
