//Question 1 - Array Stack (Bounded)- Write a generic class ArrayStack<T> that implements StackADT<T> using an array.

//Question 2 - Linked Stack (Unbounded) - Implement LinkedStack<T> using a singly linked list.

//Question 3 - Trace Question - Trace stack contents after:

/*push(10); push(20); push(30);
pop();
push(40);
peek();*/

//Question 4 - Modify pop() so it throws IllegalStateException when stack is empty.

//Question 5 - Interface - Write the interface QueueADT<T>.

//Question 6 - Circular Array Queue - Implement a bounded queue using a circular array.

//Question 7 - Linked Queue -Write a class LinkedQueue<T> using front and rear pointers.

//Question 8 - Explain why a supermarket checkout is modeled by a queue rather than a stack.

//Question 9 - Node Class - Write a generic Node<T> class for a singly linked list.

//Question 10 - Doubly Linked Node - Write a node class with prev and next.

//Question 11 - Method Writing
//In DoublyLinkedList<T> write:

/*public void addLast(T element)*/

//Question 12 - Write addFirst(T element).

//Question 13 - Write removeFirst() that throws exception if empty.

//Question 14 - Write a traversal method that prints elements from head to tail.

//Question 15 - ADT vs Data Structure - Explain the difference and give one example of each.

//Question 16 - Bounded vs Unbounded - Give one Java example of each and explain.

//Question 17 - Exception Scenario - Why must removing from an empty collection throw an exception?

//Question 18 - Write a method that reverses a stack using only stack operations.

//Question 19 - Implement a queue using two stacks
