//Abstract class - Model ownable from the UML Diagram

//Car and pet inherit from Ownable --> In Java, they 'extend' it

public class Car extends Ownable {/*...*/}
public class Pet extends Ownable {/*...*/}

//Person stores Ownable objects inside its own attribute

  }

}

//How do Java interfaces act as Abstraction?
//This allows a client class (essentially, another class) to use the object without knowing its underlying type, such as this:
//Modelling UML Diagram

ArrayList<BankAccount> myAccounts = new ArrayList<>(5); //creates a list that can store objects of type BankAccount or any subclass (like CurrentAccount or MortgageAccount)
/*...*/
myAccounts.add(new CurrentAccount()); //CurrentAccount and MortgageAccount are added because they inherit from BankAccount
myAccounts.add(new MortgageAccount());
/*...*/
showAllAccounts(myAccounts); //`showAllAccounts(myAccounts)` shows polymorphism: the method works with different account types via their common parent class.

//Working with collections - After Java 5.0

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Auction {
  private ArrayList<Lot> lots = new ArrayList<>(); //Declares a private list of `Lot` objects, initially empty, to store auction items.
/*...*/ 
  public void showLots(){ 
    for (Lot lot: lots){ //for-each loop. It goes through each Lot object in the lots list one by one. iterates over the list and prints each item.
      System.out.println(lot);
    }
  }
}

//Creating Objects 
int x; // creates a variable x to hold a primitive integer 
Integer y; //creates a variable y to hold a reference to an object of the Integer class 

y = new Integer (74); //creates a new Integer object with value 74 and sets the object reference variable y to point to the new object 

//Generic Types
//Objects whose type is not specified until class instantiation

import.java.util.ArrayList
public class Box<T> { //type variable to refer to the unknown object type,
  private ArrayList<T> contents;
/*...*/
}
